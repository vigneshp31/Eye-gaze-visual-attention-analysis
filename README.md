# Eye-gaze-visual-attention-analysis
This is a Python library that provides a webcam-based eye tracking system. 
Eye gaze treckking using machine learning is to develop a model that can accurately and reliably predict a person's gaze direction in the real time, with a high degree of accuracy and robustness.
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately determine where a person is looking, even in challenging environments with variable lighting, occlussions, and head movements.
